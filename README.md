# Emulator LUA Scripts

Mega Man X1 and Mega Man X2 scripts:
 
Compatible with snes9x-rr 1.60 and Bizhawk
 
Images must be relative to script being ran (in the same directory).

Supports Archipelago rom patches and shows currently accessible stages.
For AP and snes9x-rr 1.60 the SNI connector has to be the first script ran, then mine. But for bizhawk it can run alongside AP whatever order.
