# Emulator LUA Scripts

Mega Man X1 and Mega Man X2 scripts:
 
Compatible with snes9x-rr 1.60 and Bizhawk

Note with snes9x: It appears to ranomly have artifacts in displaying the images. If anyone knows how to debug their client feel free to fix that.

Should work with either JP or US Roms, any version.
 
Images must be relative to script being ran (in the same directory).

Supports Archipelago rom patches and shows currently accessible stages.
For AP and snes9x-rr 1.60 the SNI connector has to be the first script ran, then mine. But for bizhawk it can run alongside AP whatever order.

Let me know of any issues via Discord [Coltaho](https://discordapp.com/users/120283081939615744/) or Issue it on github.
